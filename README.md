Enable Microphone Access for open RGB in Mac OS

Issue with Audio Sync via Mac

I was unable to Access microphone in Open RGB. Upon research i found out yhat it was a common issue and there was no solution to it.When I tried to enable it from the settings, it didnâ€™t show any options for giving the microphone permissions. There was no solution for this online.

I had ran into this issue with the similar issue with another app keyboard visualizer, so I had to run the file in terminal to access the microphone which was an issue addressed on Github. So, I did the same thing here and surprisingly it worked. So, since this was a huge issue for Mac users, I uploaded the work around for Mac users on Github.

 * Run this file in terminal
 * It should open Open RGB and ask for microphone permissions.

Unfortunately, every time you need to repeat this process every time and leave the terminal running while you use Open RGB. But finally you can Access Audio In Open RGB on MAc.
